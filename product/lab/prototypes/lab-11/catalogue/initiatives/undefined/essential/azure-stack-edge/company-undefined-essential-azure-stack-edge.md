# Company undefined Essential — Azure Stack Edge

## Tier rationale

**Essential** — Baseline hygiene for Azure Stack Edge: the non-negotiable controls every deployment should enforce from day one. This tier delivers encryption-at-rest with service-managed keys. Together these policies protect against credential theft, unencrypted data exposure, and accidental data loss. Maps to CIS Benchmarks, ISO 27001 Annex A.10 (cryptography) and A.12 (operations).

## Usage

These artifacts are [EPAC](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/) (Enterprise Azure Policy as Code) definition files — deploy them as Infrastructure-as-Code via the EPAC pipeline (`Build-DeploymentPlans` → `Deploy-PolicyPlan` → `Deploy-RolesPlan`) or translate them to Terraform / Bicep. Each carries a `$schema` reference for editor validation.

| Artifact | EPAC type | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `company-undefined-essential-azure-stack-edge.policyset.json` | `policySetDefinition` (initiative) | The set of built-in policies for this (domain, tier, category), hardened effect baked in and required parameters bubbled to top-level `parameters`. Place under your EPAC `policyDefinitions/` folder. |
| `company-undefined-essential-azure-stack-edge.assignment.json` | `policyAssignment` | Binds the initiative to a scope. Replace `<root-mg-id>`, `<pac-environment-selector>`, `<sub-id>` and every `<REPLACE: …>` parameter mock, then place under `policyAssignments/`. The `description` field states this group's prerequisites (required parameter count, managed identity). |
| `company-undefined-essential-azure-stack-edge.exemptions.json` | `policyExemption` | One `Waiver` stub. Set the scope and `policyDefinitionReferenceIds` for policies that do not apply, or remove the file. Place under `policyExemptions/`. |
| `company-undefined-essential-azure-stack-edge.roles.json` | role assignments (lab helper) | Not present for this group (no Modify/DeployIfNotExists policy). Lists the `roleDefinitionIds` the assignment's managed identity needs for remediation. Not an EPAC-native file (no `$schema`) — consumed by the Terraform / Bicep renderers so they never need the policy repo downstream. |

**Deployment order:** assign the initiative → (if a managed identity is required) grant the roles from `roles.json` at the assignment scope → run remediation tasks for the Modify/DeployIfNotExists policies.

| 1 | Azure Stack Edge devices should use double-encryption | b4ac1030-89c5-4697-8e00-28b5ba6a8811 |  | To secure the data at rest on the device, ensure it's double-encrypted, the access to data is controlled, and once the device is deactivated, the data is securely erased off the data disks. Double encryption is the use of two layers of encryption: BitLocker XTS-AES 256-bit encryption on the data volumes and built-in encryption of the hard drives.
