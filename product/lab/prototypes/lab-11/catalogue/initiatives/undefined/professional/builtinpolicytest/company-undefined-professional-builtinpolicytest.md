# Company undefined Professional — BuiltInPolicyTest

## Tier rationale

**Professional** — Active security posture for BuiltInPolicyTest: controls that produce signals an operations team must act on. This tier delivers auto-remediation deployments. Together these policies protect against unauthorized network exposure, exploitable vulnerabilities, and undetected privilege misuse. Maps to NIS2 Article 21 (detection & response), ISO 27001 A.12.4 (logging) and A.13 (network security).

## Usage

These artifacts are [EPAC](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/) (Enterprise Azure Policy as Code) definition files — deploy them as Infrastructure-as-Code via the EPAC pipeline (`Build-DeploymentPlans` → `Deploy-PolicyPlan` → `Deploy-RolesPlan`) or translate them to Terraform / Bicep. Each carries a `$schema` reference for editor validation.

| Artifact | EPAC type | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `company-undefined-professional-builtinpolicytest.policyset.json` | `policySetDefinition` (initiative) | The set of built-in policies for this (domain, tier, category), hardened effect baked in and required parameters bubbled to top-level `parameters`. Place under your EPAC `policyDefinitions/` folder. |
| `company-undefined-professional-builtinpolicytest.assignment.json` | `policyAssignment` | Binds the initiative to a scope. Replace `<root-mg-id>`, `<pac-environment-selector>`, `<sub-id>` and every `<REPLACE: …>` parameter mock, then place under `policyAssignments/`. The `description` field states this group's prerequisites (required parameter count, managed identity). |
| `company-undefined-professional-builtinpolicytest.exemptions.json` | `policyExemption` | One `Waiver` stub. Set the scope and `policyDefinitionReferenceIds` for policies that do not apply, or remove the file. Place under `policyExemptions/`. |
| `company-undefined-professional-builtinpolicytest.roles.json` | role assignments (lab helper) | Not present for this group (no Modify/DeployIfNotExists policy). Lists the `roleDefinitionIds` the assignment's managed identity needs for remediation. Not an EPAC-native file (no `$schema`) — consumed by the Terraform / Bicep renderers so they never need the policy repo downstream. |

**Deployment order:** assign the initiative → (if a managed identity is required) grant the roles from `roles.json` at the assignment scope → run remediation tasks for the Modify/DeployIfNotExists policies.

## Policies

| # | Policy | Policy ID | Tag | Description | Requires Parameters | Requires Managed Identity | Allowed Values | Default Value | Soft Value | Hardened Value | Category | Domain | Version | Type | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Append a tag and its value to resources - This built-in is created for versioning test. | 125b7269-7ec9-47bf-8beb-8865b61c2c95 | Preview | Appends the specified tag and value when any resource which is missing this tag is created or updated. Does not modify the tags of resources created before this policy was applied until those resources are changed. Does not apply to resource groups. New 'modify' effect policies are available that support remediation of tags on existing resources (see https://aka.ms/modifydoc). | Yes | No | Append, Disabled | Append | Append | Append | BuiltInPolicyTest | undefined | 1.0.0-preview | BuiltIn | Professional |
