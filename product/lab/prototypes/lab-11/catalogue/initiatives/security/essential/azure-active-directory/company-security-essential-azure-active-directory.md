# Company Security Essential — Azure Active Directory

## Tier rationale

**Essential** — Baseline hygiene for Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD): the non-negotiable controls every deployment should enforce from day one. This tier delivers TLS / HTTPS enforcement preventing in-transit interception. Together these policies protect against credential theft, unencrypted data exposure, and accidental data loss. Maps to CIS Benchmarks, ISO 27001 Annex A.10 (cryptography) and A.12 (operations).

## Usage

These artifacts are [EPAC](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/) (Enterprise Azure Policy as Code) definition files — deploy them as Infrastructure-as-Code via the EPAC pipeline (`Build-DeploymentPlans` → `Deploy-PolicyPlan` → `Deploy-RolesPlan`) or translate them to Terraform / Bicep. Each carries a `$schema` reference for editor validation.

| Artifact | EPAC type | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `company-security-essential-azure-active-directory.policyset.json` | `policySetDefinition` (initiative) | The set of built-in policies for this (domain, tier, category), hardened effect baked in and required parameters bubbled to top-level `parameters`. Place under your EPAC `policyDefinitions/` folder. |
| `company-security-essential-azure-active-directory.assignment.json` | `policyAssignment` | Binds the initiative to a scope. Replace `<root-mg-id>`, `<pac-environment-selector>`, `<sub-id>` and every `<REPLACE: …>` parameter mock, then place under `policyAssignments/`. The `description` field states this group's prerequisites (required parameter count, managed identity). |
| `company-security-essential-azure-active-directory.exemptions.json` | `policyExemption` | One `Waiver` stub. Set the scope and `policyDefinitionReferenceIds` for policies that do not apply, or remove the file. Place under `policyExemptions/`. |
| `company-security-essential-azure-active-directory.roles.json` | role assignments (lab helper) | Not present for this group (no Modify/DeployIfNotExists policy). Lists the `roleDefinitionIds` the assignment's managed identity needs for remediation. Not an EPAC-native file (no `$schema`) — consumed by the Terraform / Bicep renderers so they never need the policy repo downstream. |

**Deployment order:** assign the initiative → (if a managed identity is required) grant the roles from `roles.json` at the assignment scope → run remediation tasks for the Modify/DeployIfNotExists policies.

## Policies

| # | Policy | Policy ID | Tag | Description | Requires Parameters | Requires Managed Identity | Allowed Values | Default Value | Soft Value | Hardened Value | Category | Domain | Version | Type | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domains should use TLS 1.2 only mode | 3aa87b5a-7813-4b57-8a43-42dd9df5aaa7 |  | Use TLS 1.2 only mode for your managed domains. By default, Azure AD Domain Services enables the use of ciphers such as NTLM v1 and TLS v1. These ciphers may be required for some legacy applications, but are considered weak and can be disabled if you don't need them. When TLS 1.2 only mode is enabled, any client making a request that is not using TLS 1.2 will fail.
