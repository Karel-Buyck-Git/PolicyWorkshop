# Company Management Enterprise — Automatic Update

## Tier rationale

**Enterprise** — Zero-trust and regulatory alignment for Automatic Update: controls that require infrastructure investment or map directly to compliance frameworks. This tier delivers zone-redundant deployments backing the 99.99% SLA. Together these policies protect against lateral movement, sovereign-data exfiltration, and audit gaps in regulated workloads. Maps to NIS2 Articles 21–23, ISO 27001 A.13.1.3 (network segregation) and A.18 (compliance), NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust).

## Usage

These artifacts are [EPAC](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/) (Enterprise Azure Policy as Code) definition files — deploy them as Infrastructure-as-Code via the EPAC pipeline (`Build-DeploymentPlans` → `Deploy-PolicyPlan` → `Deploy-RolesPlan`) or translate them to Terraform / Bicep. Each carries a `$schema` reference for editor validation.

| Artifact | EPAC type | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `company-management-enterprise-automatic-update.policyset.json` | `policySetDefinition` (initiative) | The set of built-in policies for this (domain, tier, category), hardened effect baked in and required parameters bubbled to top-level `parameters`. Place under your EPAC `policyDefinitions/` folder. |
| `company-management-enterprise-automatic-update.assignment.json` | `policyAssignment` | Binds the initiative to a scope. Replace `<root-mg-id>`, `<pac-environment-selector>`, `<sub-id>` and every `<REPLACE: …>` parameter mock, then place under `policyAssignments/`. The `description` field states this group's prerequisites (required parameter count, managed identity). |
| `company-management-enterprise-automatic-update.exemptions.json` | `policyExemption` | One `Waiver` stub. Set the scope and `policyDefinitionReferenceIds` for policies that do not apply, or remove the file. Place under `policyExemptions/`. |
| `company-management-enterprise-automatic-update.roles.json` | role assignments (lab helper) | Present for this group. Lists the `roleDefinitionIds` the assignment's managed identity needs for remediation. Not an EPAC-native file (no `$schema`) — consumed by the Terraform / Bicep renderers so they never need the policy repo downstream. |

**Deployment order:** assign the initiative → (if a managed identity is required) grant the roles from `roles.json` at the assignment scope → run remediation tasks for the Modify/DeployIfNotExists policies.

## Policies

| # | Policy | Policy ID | Tag | Description | Requires Parameters | Requires Managed Identity | Allowed Values | Default Value | Soft Value | Hardened Value | Category | Domain | Version | Type | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Virtual Machine Scale Sets with more than 2 availability zones should have automatic AZ rebalancing enabled | 40d17f6f-a9d2-4f1d-8c37-a699a5372a87 | Preview | This policy enables automatic AZ rebalancing for Virtual Machine Scale Sets that are otherwise zone resilient. Automatic zone rebalancing helps to ensure that your Virtual Machine Scale Sets are evenly distributed across the zones in the region. | No | Yes | Modify, Disabled | Modify | Modify | Modify | Automatic Update | Management | 1.0.0-preview | BuiltIn | Enterprise |
